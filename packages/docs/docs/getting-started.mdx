### 1. Install

npm

```bash
npm install @toastup/react
```

yarn

```bash
yarn add @toastup/react
```

### 2. Integrate

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => add({ type: "success", title: "test" })}>
        Add toast
      </button>
      <Toaster />
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::warning
Make sure to include the Toaster component exactly once in your application structure.
If you're unsure where to place it, best place is the root of your application.
