Enabling body animation is as simple as adding the `animateBody` property to the `add` function.

import { BodyAnimationExample } from "@site/src/components/examples/BodyAnimationExample";

<BodyAnimationExample />

## Example

To enable body animation set `animateBody` to `true`.

```ts
add({ animateBody: true });
```

There are three built-in body animations: `zoom`, `slideHorizontal` and `slideVertical`.
You can change the default by setting `inBodyAnimation` property.

```ts
import { slideVerticallyWithFadeInBody } from "@toastup/react";

add({
  animateBody: true,
  inBodyAnimation: slideVerticallyWithFadeInBody,
});
```

import { Blob1 } from "@site/src/components/Blobs/Blob1";

<Blob1 />
