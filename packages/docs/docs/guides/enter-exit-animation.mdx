description: How to change enter and exit animations.
---

There are eight built-in enter and exit animations: `fade`, `zoom`, `zoom with bounce`, `slide vertically`, `slide horizontally`, `bounce horizontally`, `single bounce horizontally`, `single bounce vertically`.

import { EnterExitAnimationExample } from "@site/src/components/examples/EnterExitAnimationExample";

<EnterExitAnimationExample />

## Example

You can change the default by setting `inAnimation` and `outAnimation` properties.
`inAnimation` can be different from `outAnimation`.

```ts
import {
  bounceHorizontallyIn,
  singleBounceVerticallyOut,
} from "@toastup/react";

add({
  inAnimation: bounceHorizontallyIn,
  outAnimation: singleBounceVerticallyOut,
});
```

import { Blob1 } from "@site/src/components/Blobs/Blob1";

<Blob1 />
